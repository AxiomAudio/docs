## Development environment

In order to develop new functionalities of Volumio, depending on which part you want to improve, you need to set up a development environment.
Volumio is designed to be an highly integrated system. This means that the WebUi is optimized to work along with the custom made Volumio system, and therefore it needs to run in a very tightly controlled environment. IT WON'T WORK on standard Raspbian or other non-volumio OSes. If you want to know what kind of customizations we're using, take a look at the [Volumio Builder](https://github.com/volumio/Build)

So, we suggest to have a running Volumio device connected to your local network, while developing on your machine
